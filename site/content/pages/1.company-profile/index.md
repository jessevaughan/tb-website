intro: |
  <p>In the summer of 1946, Tuckman-Barbee Construction Co., Inc. was founded by Mr. H. Graham Barbee, Jr., Mr. David Tuckman and Mr. A. E. Lichtman.  With our first project, the renovation of the home of Mr. Milton Starr, we began building a reputation for competitive pricing, quality construction and professional project management.

our_mission: |
  <p>While over the past few years "Partnering" may have become a cliché... one representing an ideal relationship between owners, designers, architects, general contractors, employees, subcontractors and suppliers. Tuckman-Barbee has, since inception, called this “business as usual.” Treating people with respect, setting reasonable goals, then working hard to achieve them. Knowing that in order for a project to be successful each and every member of the project team must be successful has been, and continues to be, the key to Tuckman-Barbee’s success.
