Your careful planning, collaboration and cooperation with Georgetown, careful selection of subcontractors, strong organization, leadership and creative problem-solving helped to insure the successful on-time and under-budget completion of this project. I want to extend my sincere thanks to the entire Tuckman-Barbee team for the years of dedicated and responsive service to Georgetown University and Student Services and Facilities. I would welcome every opportunity to provide a reference and strong recommendation for Tuckman-Barbee. You have earned my trust and confidence.
