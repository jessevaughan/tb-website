I can speak for every member of the building committee and all the members of our congregation when I tell you we could not be more pleased with the final product.  The attention to detail that was preformed by Tuckman-Barbee was outstanding.  As the Director of Church Administration, I worked very closely with their team and once again I never had to question their loyalty or their desire to insure we were going to be pleased with the entire project.  We had some change orders, thru no fault of Tuckman-Barbee, and they worked on our behalf to assure the job was finished to our complete satisfaction.  We are so proud of their work.  I would invite anyone to visit our church and attest for yourself the outstanding job performed by Tuckman-Barbee.  If you have any questions please feel free to call me; I would be more than happy to answer any questions.
