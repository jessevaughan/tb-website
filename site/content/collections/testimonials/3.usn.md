Tuckman-Barbeeâ€™s outstanding performance on this time sensitive project greatly exceeded all our expectations in delivering on time construction. This as an exceptional achievement given a fast-tracked three month construction window... this task was even more challenging with the residence remaining occupied throughout the construction. The craftsmanship and finished quality were exquisite ... every aspect of the construction was carefully sequenced and aggressively executed by your team.
