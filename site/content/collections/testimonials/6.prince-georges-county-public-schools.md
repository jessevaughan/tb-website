It is indeed a pleasure to highly recommend Tuckman-Barbee for the admirable performance you demonstrated on these projects. We were very doubtful these additions would be completed on time ... but when asked to deliver two sites two weeks early Tuckman-Barbee accomplished that too. The quality of the personnel and the selection of subcontractors that Tuckman-Barbee assembled with their fine project administration kept these projects progressing at a very rapid pace. I look forward to working with Tuckman-Barbee in the future.
