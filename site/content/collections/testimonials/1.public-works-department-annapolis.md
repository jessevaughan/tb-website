The contractor's quality control was outstanding. They were diligent about all three phases of control and their quality of workmanship was excellent. The final product was "awe" inspiring….. The project was not only completed with unmatched quality but was completed early in an already tight schedule…… The contractor won multiple NAVFAC safety awards during the project as well as two of their employees. Their safety awards were a product of their tireless work compiling and implementing the safety plan….. This contract established a new benchmark for quality and execution at the Naval Academy. Well done and I look forward to executing future work with Tuckman-Barbee.
